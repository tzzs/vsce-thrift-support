## üöÄ Features

### Syntax Highlighting
- Full Thrift syntax coverage: keywords, data types, strings, comments, numeric literals
- Supports all primitive and container types (including `uuid`)
- Smart token coloring for better readability

### Code Formatting
- Document formatting: format the entire Thrift file with one command
- Selection formatting: format only the selected text
- Smart alignment: align field types, field names, and comments
- Configurable: indentation, line length, and more formatting rules

> Publisher namespace: tanzz (used for both VS Marketplace and Open VSX)

### Code Navigation
- Go to Definition: jump to type definitions quickly
- Include resolution: follow `include` statements across files
- Workspace search: find definitions across the workspace

### Code Refactoring
- Identifier rename (F2): updates references across files with basic conflict checks
- Extract type (typedef): infer type from selection or current field and generate a `typedef`
- Move type to file: move `struct/enum/service/typedef` into a new `.thrift` file and auto-insert an `include`

## üì¶ Installation

1. Open VSCode
2. Open the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
3. Search for "Thrift Support"
4. Click Install

## üîß Usage

### Formatting
- Format Document: `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+I` (macOS)
- Format Selection: select text, then `Ctrl+K Ctrl+F` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+K Cmd+F` (macOS)
- Command Palette:
  - `Thrift: Format Document`
  - `Thrift: Format Selection`

### Code Navigation
- Go to Definition: `F12` or `Ctrl+Click`
- Peek Definition: `Alt+F12`

### Diagnostics
- Syntax pairing and unclosed checks (syntax.unmatchedCloser / syntax.unclosed)
- Type checks: unknown types and typedef base (type.unknown / typedef.unknownBase)
- Container inner type checks: validate inner types of list/map/set
- Enum constraints: values must be non-negative integers (enum.negativeValue / enum.valueNotInteger)
- Default value type checks: including base types and UUID string format (value.typeMismatch)
- Service constraints:
  - oneway must return void and must not declare throws (service.oneway.returnNotVoid / service.oneway.hasThrows)
  - throws must reference known exception types (service.throws.unknown / service.throws.notException)
  - extends must target a service type (service.extends.unknown / service.extends.notService)
- Robust default value extraction improvements:
  - Ignore '=' inside field annotations so it won‚Äôt be treated as the start of a default value
  - set<T> default values accept either `[]` or `{}` with bracket-aware element checks

Note: Diagnostics update in real-time during editing and on save. You can review them in VSCode‚Äôs ‚ÄúProblems‚Äù panel.

### Code Refactoring
- Identifier rename (F2): cross-file reference updates with basic conflict checks
- Extract type (typedef): infer type from selection/current field and generate a `typedef`
- Move type to file: move `struct/enum/service/typedef` into a new `.thrift` file and auto-insert an `include`

## üìê Language Spec Alignment (IDL 0.23)

- Starting from Apache Thrift IDL 0.23, `uuid` is treated as a built-in base type in this extension.
- Alignment touches the following components:
  - Diagnostics: `uuid` is recognized as a primitive type
  - Definition Provider: `uuid` is excluded from user-defined symbol navigation
  - Syntax Highlighting: `uuid` is included in the primitive type regex
- Reference: Apache Thrift IDL ‚Äî https://thrift.apache.org/docs/idl
