# Conventional Commits Template
# Specification: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary
#
# Basic format:
#   <type>(<scope>)!: <description>
#
# Key rules:
# - type is required; scope is optional; if there is a breaking change, you can add an exclamation mark ! after type or scope, or use BREAKING CHANGE: in the footer for explanation
# - There must be a space after the colon; <description> is a brief summary
# - Leave one blank line between <description> and body (optional); leave another blank line between body and footer (optional)
#
# Semantic versioning relationship (the specification only has implicit semantics for the following two categories, other types have no built-in semantics):
# - feat: New feature (corresponds to SemVer MINOR)
# - fix: Bug fix (corresponds to SemVer PATCH)
# - Any type containing BREAKING CHANGE: is considered MAJOR
#
# Common types (non-mandatory list, no built-in semantics except feat/fix):
#   docs      Documentation
#   style     Code style (spaces/formatting/semicolons, etc., not CSS)
#   refactor  Refactoring (neither new features nor bug fixes)
#   perf      Performance optimization
#   test      Test related
#   build     Build system or dependencies
#   ci        CI configuration
#   chore     Miscellaneous
#   revert    Rollback
#
# Example 1 (regular change):
#   feat(formatter): Support alignStructDefaults independent switch

#
# Example 2 (breaking change, using ! and BREAKING CHANGE footer either or both):

#
